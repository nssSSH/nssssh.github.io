# Is Librewolf Worth it?

Let's be honest: everyone knows that Chrome is just a spyware. It's not even a hidden fact now. As such, there was been a lot of people switching from Chrome to other browsers, which is the reason now that more and more people are using Firefox now, albeit their marketshare has been low. 

Privacy has always been the main focus of Firefox, which well aged quite questionable, there are some other forks of Firefox which strip Firefox pretty bare bones but increase the privacy. 
If you've ever been searching for a privacy focused browser, Librewolf must've crossed your mind atleast one. 
There are some other options too, such as Brave browser, but it is based on Chromium. Not all, but it throws some (including me) people off. Maybe some want diversity in web. Having multiple options is good, right? 

I mean, Firefox isn't the best browser, definitely, but I used to use it because it wasn't Chrome. That was the main appeal of Firefox for me.

For Firefox trying to be like Chrome is like trying to throw a axe at their own foot. It's meaningless. 

Anyway, back to the point. For all my time using Librewolf, I'd give it a pretty 9.4/10. Pretty specific. The only reason for me not giving it a 10/10 is because certain features are turned off by default, which makes it break on certain sites. Not all, but selective few. 

If you are a privacy focused person then I 100% recommend you try our Librewolf. After that, you can use something like Arkenfox. 

Thanks.
