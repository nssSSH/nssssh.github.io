## Is Firefox going pro-AI a good thing or a bad thing for the community?

It's only a few days (16th December) ago since Mozilla got a new CEO: Anthony Enzor-Demeo. I suppose our new internet overload come from a business background hence he doesn't quite know the real reason why people use Firefox. People don't use Firefox because of the features — it's not that great or innovative (even compared to Chrome!) — but because it's NOT Chrome! 

That's the main selling point of Firefox. If it's going to be "yet another modern AI browser" blah blah blah, I might as well use Comet or Atlas or whatever the fuck AI slop is out there. But I don't want to. And that's why I USE FIREFOX!!!! 

But whatever, the upper management hardly cares what users feel at the ground level. It's the same for every company.
