In the world of tomfoolery and corporations rampaging over your privacy like it never fucking existed is now very unfortunately normalized.  In a world where your data is priceless and everyone wants a share of some, it is expected that apps you once trusted is now a data hungry software collecting every single minute little detail about you. They claim that it is "opt out" but where the duck is the option to disable it? I don't want to go inside a damn jungle to restrict you from viewing my name, email address, phone number, birthdate, gender, profile photo, payment information, device information (such as hardware model, operating system, device identifiers, and mobile network information), IP address, location data (precise or approximate), search queries, browsing history, app usage data, cookies and similar tracking technologies, interaction with emails (like opens, clicks, and attachments), contacts and their information, calendar events, content I create or upload (documents, emails, photos, videos), voice and audio recordings, purchase activity, YouTube watch and search history, advertising interactions, demographic information, language preferences, settings and preferences, crash reports, diagnostic information, and inferred interests or behavior patterns based on my activity, even including data from third-party sites and apps that use Google services, whether I’ve opted in or out of personalized features.

Yeah, that's alot. So I tried finding something better. Something more privacy focused. In a world of shitty corporations, it was indeed pretty hard. But I found something, and I'd like to share that with you...

## Hero of our story: Proton Mail
I suppose you guys already know what Proton Mail is. If not, Proton Mail is a email service provided by Proton, a company based in Switzerland. They have a whole ecosystem of services, such as VPNs, Calendar etc. Their main focus always have been Privacy.

For a consumer viewpoint, Proton Mail tries to offer something that Gmail can't: Privacy. Privacy is main selling point of Proton mail, and I think that it does a pretty great job.

According to a [article](https://www.wired.com/review/proton-mail/) by WIRED, 
> Like other Proton apps, Proton Mail emphasizes security and privacy, but a big feature for me is that it works for you, not against you.

Similar to you, I also created my Gmail account ages ago. Well, not that long ago, but you get the idea. I've used it for everything, EVERY SINGLE THING. I shouldn't have done that, as it is good to have multiple email addresses, but whatever. 
Proton Mail gave me a fresh start and it's wonderful.

Most email providers claim that "your emails are encrypted" but they never claim how it is encrypted. Most of the time, it's just encrypted during transit via TLS, but it gets decrypted when it reaches their servers. But in Proton, your emails are always End-to-end encrypted, meaning even Proton cannot see your message. 
It also blocks email trackers which is very useful. 

If I had to give a rating to Proton Mail, I'd give it 9/10.

But that's just from a consumer standpoint.

If you are a journalist or someone seeking super high level email security and privacy, there's nothing better than self hosting your own email server. There's nothing more privacy friendly than self hosting your own mail, though it comes with its own bells and whistles. 

Thanks for reading till now, I'm NSS from NoClanker (shitty) News. See you next time.
